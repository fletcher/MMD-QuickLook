# MultiMarkdown QuickLook Plugin #

## Introduction ##

This is a complete rewrite of the MultiMarkdown version of Phil Toland's QLMarkdown plugin.  The MMD version caused multiple copies of the `multimarkdown` process to spawn and run the CPU usage to 100%.  I'm sure it was something I did, and not a problem with qlmarkdown. 

But in order to fix it, it just made more sense to start over.

This program allows you to preview a MultiMarkdown text file (or OPML file) in the Finder after converting it to HTML with MMD.

## Installation ##

To install, simply put the "MultiMarkdown QuickLook" file in:

	~/Library/QuickLook

To uninstall, simply remove it.

This version of the QuickLook plugin includes an embedded copy of MultiMarkdown 3.2, as well as `opml2mmd.xslt`.  So there's nothing else to install to get it to work.  The version of mmd that's embedded should run on any Intel Mac.
